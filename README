A set of clippings adjusted or created to match the formatting I like to use in BBEdit. 

Current clippings just adjust paragraph and DIV tags in HTML to put content on the next line automatically indented.

These should be copied into ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Clippings/HTML.html/, or into ~/Dropbox/Application Support/BBEdit/Clippings/HTML.html/ if you have BBEdit set up to sync.
